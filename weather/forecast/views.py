    # -------------------------------------- YOUR MISSION --------------------------------------

    # It's wasteful for us to fetch the forecast from Yr for every page request when we know
    # that a forecast from 5 minutes ago (or longer) is still fine to use

    # If we're not careful Yr will start throttling our requests which will break our app.

    # In this exercise the API call to Yr has been moved out of this view function and put in
    # its own function 'fetch_forecast'.

    # This new function returns both the yr data we have already been using as well as when the
    # data expires.

    # We want to minimise how often we call this function by using caching to save Yr responses
    # for a period of time. If we have a value in the cache, we can use that rather than fetch
    # new values. Only if we have no value in the cache (or the value we have has expired) do we
    # want to call the function.

    # A 3 second sleep penalty has been added to fetch_forecast to simulate a slow API request.

    # Tips:
    # - Relevant docs: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/cache/#the-low-level-cache-api
    # - Use the default cache. This gets wiped every time your local server restarts.
    # - Make sure you cache each location's forecast with a unique key
    # - Start by expiring forecasts after, say, 10 seconds.
    # - Then see if you can use the expires_at value to expire forecasts when Yr wants us to
    # - Replace the two lines that follow this comment with your improved caching functionality.
    # - Everything can stay the same.
